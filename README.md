# `edfinr` Hackathon Prep

Here’s a quick prep checklist so you’re set up and ready to roll:

## 🧰 Before we start

1️⃣ Update R and RStudio
Make sure you’re running reasonably current versions:

- R: version 4.3 or later
- RStudio: 2023.12 or later

You can download the latest versions here:

- [R download page](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- [RStudio (Posit) download page](https://posit.co/download/rstudio/)

2️⃣ Install or update the packages we’ll be using

First, run this code to make sure you have the packages we'll use:
```{r}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "scales", "viridis", "edfinr"))
```
Then check that everything loads without errors:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(viridis)
library(edfinr)
```

3️⃣ Think about a couple of STB brief concepts you might like to explore

Browse the Splitting the Bill series for inspiration:

## 🕙 Run of show reminder

- 10:00–10:30am (Zoom): Kickoff + framing + sample code
- 10:30am–12:30pm: Hack time (solo or small groups)
- 12:30–1:00pm: Share-out (one chart + one short headline or takeaway)

## ☕ Optional bonus prep

Bring your favorite fall beverage — PSLs, cider, or plain black coffee all count as valid fuel for data creativity.
